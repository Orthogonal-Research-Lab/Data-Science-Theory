## Meta- and Mini-theories  

### Types of Theory (Philosophy of Science)  
Reductive Theory: a theory that is reducible to mechanism.

Effective theory: describes a set of observations without an explicit mechanism.

### Psychophysical Laws (mini-theory)   
[Weberâ€“Fechner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weber%E2%80%93Fechner_law): the relationship between accurately estimating quantities and the number of objects presented simultaneously.  

[Fitts'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitts%27s_law): the relationship between spped of movement and accuracy of movement.  

[Stevens' Power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stevens%27s_power_law): the relationship between the intensity of a stimulus and its ability to be perceived.  

[Hick-Hyman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hick%27s_law): logarithmic tradeoff between the number of choices and the time to make a decision.

[Pieron's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henri_Pi%C3%A9ron): logarithmic tradeoff between stimulus intensity and the time to make a decision.

### Meta-theory (collection of mini-theories):  
Descriptions of collective behavior: [flocks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flocking_(behavior)), [swarms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swarm_intelligence), and [agent-based interactions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agent-based_model). Collective behavior is often greater than the sum of its parts, but is [not reducible to simple (or mini-theoretic) descriptions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_irreducibility).  

Automated Hypothesis Discovery/Theorem Formation: the unsupervised discovery of rules (or regularities) from data.

### Perceptual False Positives  
[Apophenia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apophenia): the tendency to misattribute one cause with another.  

[Pareidolia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareidolia): the tendency to find patterns in randomness.  

[Clustering illusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clustering_illusion): the tendency to see non-random groupings where none exist.
