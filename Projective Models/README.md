Projective model definition: a quantitative representation that models scenarios about networks of events from multiple perspectives.

* not simply based on prior distributions, but a set of paths between the past and future.

* allied ideas: out-of-distribution events, rare events and black swans, distorted worlds.

* predictions of future wrong, even given a broadly correct conceptual model.

Consequences for Mental Model:
1) prediction from mental models require historical precedent or comparators -- no historical precendent presents a problem.

2) prediction from mental models requires infinite growth or infinite scaling -- real world does not behave this way.

3) changes in worldview occur or are required, and lead to other changes in perspective -- geocentrism vs. heliocentrism.

4) vague statements matched to common events lead to predictive ambiguities -- can be semantic (Nostradamus) or statistical (spurious correlation).
