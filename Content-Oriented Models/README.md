## Content-Oriented Models 

### Examples:

* preferential attachment (describes dynamic process in networks of new nodes attaching to existing network).

* Fechner's Law (describes ability to judge numeric values based on density of stimulus). 

Both examples describe a regularity, along with a certain percentage of the total variation. 


### Structure vs. tendency vs. completeness:  

* structure: _m_-by-_n_ array, clusters, distributions.

* tendency: content-oriented model, statistical distribution.  

* completeness: does observed data equal the full range of a system (e.g. ergodic).  


Content-oriented models can be combined with measurments to create an abstraction.
